# Advent of Code

Personal solutions for AoC, though not all days nor parts nor years. Some might yet to be processed through and checked for bad old code and copypaste and such.

# 2015 - 2019

A mess of Lua stuff, with a random C program thrown in at some point. Not really made to be readable easily by anyone back then.

# 2020

Currently written in Deno flavoured TypeScript, except for Day 1 which is plain JS that can be pasted into browser.

# 2021

Days 1 through 3 are designed to be run in the Developer Tools of the browser, just point it at the page with input and it will run. Day 4 (and onwards, probably) is in Deno like 2020
